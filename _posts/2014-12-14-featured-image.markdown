##This is partially cross-posted from <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/a-temporary-transfer-data-and-technology-fellowship-at-open-society-foundations/">The Engine Room blog</a>##


<p>Over the past several years, The Engine Room has worked with a variety of philanthropies to better understand the changing landscape of data and technology for social change. We think that support organisations like The Engine Room are well placed to inform philanthropy about the data and technology needs of the social sector. We see our own funders as peers with whom we work to better understand how data and technology can increase impact in the social sector, without causing harm or exacerbating inequalities in existing power relationships.

This year, I am happy to report, I will be taking some time to work more closely with Open Society Foundations. The Information Program of the Foundation has a diverse portfolio focused on both the uptake of data and technology tools by the social sector and addressing the social implications of the rise of data and technology in society. The Information Program team at OSF has been a key ally since the founding of The Engine Room. We share several goals, the most salient being the responsible data agenda and an interest in developing a vibrant and nuanced data and technology ecosystem for the social sector.

My work with the Information Program will be structured as a fellowship, running from November 2016 to April 2017, and will focus on three main areas of investigation:

- How Open Society Foundations can build internal systems to support its diverse program teams and staff to support the effective use of data and technology to increase impact
- What is an effective balance between experimentation in emerging technology and necessary infrastructure of data and technology support ecosystem for the social sector
- Professional development in data and technology that can empower substance experts to incorporate data and technology into their strategies

This seemed like as good a time as any to launch a blog that I can use to share my thoughts as me me, and not me, the director of The Engine Room. 

Side note: this git commit was made at 30,000 feet, somewhere over Canada. We live in the future.
