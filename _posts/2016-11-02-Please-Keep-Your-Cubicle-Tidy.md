It's been a week since I started at the first 'institution' I've ever spent time in. And in a week I've learned a lot. 

Like:
- IT departments are really great, but they are built to systematically integrate large numbers of people with varying technical skills into an infrastructure where they can't break things. This means, they treat you like you will probably break things if you are allowed to make choices. This is great, when they give you a device that automagically connects to wifi, printers, your email account, and a litany of services. It's awful when you have to fill out a form to request persmission to have a password manager on your machine. People telling me what I can and can't do it already making me feel less capable (and frustrated).
- Working from home is so great. I knew that already, but having all of these people hanging out in my living room is really throwing me off. I think remote working has managed to obscure the fact that I am an introvert. I knew I was, but office working makes it much clearer.
- Structured onboarding is sensible, but being on the receiving end of it reminds me that information cascades aren't very unhelpful. I am also reminded of a feeling I've had since childhood: instructions are overrated. 
- I hate email now! Sorry Zara for my not understanding why people hate email. My hatred might be partly because I am using two computers and said IT department makes it impossible to use a non-OSF email client for email. I think it's mostly that Thunderbird is the email client I choose to hate, and an Outlook inbox feels like the surface of Mars.
- Institutions having mostly women middle management and almost exclusively male leadership is a thing.
