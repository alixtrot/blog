It's been a week since I started at the first 'institution' I've ever spent time in. And in a week I've learned a lot. 

Like:

* Insitutions attract a huge amount of talent. I've had conversation after conversation with passionate, interesting, and deeply smart people. And there are so. many. people. to meet.
* IT departments are an amazing resource, but they are built to systematically integrate large numbers of people with varying technical skills into an infrastructure where they can't break things. This means, they treat you like you will probably break things if you are allowed to make choices. This is great, when they give you a device that automagically connects to wifi, printers, your email account, and a litany of services. It's awful when you have to fill out a form to request persmission to have a password manager on your machine. People telling me what I can and can't do it already making me feel less capable.
* Working from home is so great. I knew that already, but having all of these people hanging out in my living room is really throwing me off!
* Institutions having mostly women middle management and almost exclusively male leadership is a thing.
