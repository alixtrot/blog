For what it's worth, I feel less despondent about the election now, and my brain has started to work a little bit better. And I'm seeing some things more clearly. 

I am a [gay, white, American, southern] liberal. I actively pursue continuous learning and progressive evolution of my own views as I learn more about more causes, struggles, and experiences. And I’m seeing a political problem that we need to fix: liberals (like me) need to stop self-cannibalising the liberal movement. We need to stop trying to embarrass people who aren’t sufficiently oppressed, progressive, demographically just so, or steeped in language that makes them sound woke. We need to stop language policing people who show up for liberal causes. They showed up - they are not the enemy. 

There are many examples in the past years I could draw on, but for now I will pick on myself. My step-father is a big D democrat, Clinton voter, ‘radical’ by American standards on some important issues like Palestine, has two gay daughters, and tries really hard to learn and be an ally. He lives in a southern American city and is hurt and confused that racism seems to have won the day yet again. He started wearing a safety pin after the election. 

## Multiple choice quiz. Did I:

A. Support this choice as a way of signalling in a post-election racially charged southern city that there are white men who are not Trump supporters - and push some of the white men he knows who are Trump supporters to confront ‘people like them’ that aren’t
B. Ask him if and how this election feels different to him, why he chose the safety pin and what he thinks current times mean
C. Support his choice as a way of showing minority and marginalised groups in his physical vicinity that they have an ally (who is well past 6-feet tall and 200 pounds)

No, I didn’t choose any of those things. I chose D. to find an article about safety pins describing them as an insufficient gimmick to make white people feel better and 5 steps on how someone interested in trivial safety pins could become a legitimate ally.

And then...I didn’t send it.

I realised that I was part of the problem. I was telling this guy who wanted to play a force for good to not do what he was doing, and to instead ‘read more’ and ‘engage more’ and ‘do something else’ to become even more aware of his privilege. I was undermining his effort by telling him that it was insufficient. This instinct, to call others out on not being sufficient, or not getting it, is a form of self-cannibalism in liberal communities. It is not galvanizing or helpful; it is petty. It is a type of power play. And we need to stop it. 

Call-out culture can make you feel good when you are on the right side of it. Telling someone who is making an effort that they aren’t good enough is a powerful act. And like most powerful and petty acts, it is counterproductive and corrosive.

### It has four major effects (that I can see):
- It creates a chilling effect for people otherwise very interested in learning more about liberal causes. People are afraid of feeling inadequate and despite their good intent they are shut out from taking action that may be worthwhile (though not sufficient).
-It flattens creativity in liberal communities because it encourages both conformity and self-questioning that can lead to paralysis.
- It undermines the growth of liberal movements because it spawns attacks on newcomers. It pushes us toward individual introspection at the expense of broad appeals to the public. 
- It makes people resent us. Telling people how to talk, calling them out when they try to communicate because they have used the wrong words or ideas and frames of thinking that feel different, or telling them that their words or actions have less value because of their demography, is frustrating and painful (as many of us well know). All white straight men aren’t the same, and treating them - or any other demography - as a monolith is not just wrong it is unstrategic. We need to broaden our base of support, and to do that we need to be able to recognise the difference between allies and enemies. 
- It makes organising for liberal causes increasingly difficult. Creating space for diverse communities to healthily engage is absolutely critical. Diversity is the only path to success. But to trap ourselves in an unending process of community self-reflection and self-critique is to fail at our goals of broadening engagement and to be frank, winning.

### What am I going to do about it?
- I’m going to encourage people that are working to be allies. And not critique their efforts unless I think what they are suggesting will cause harm. 
- I’m not going to discount someone’s ideas because of the words they choose to use in articulating them if they are clearly coming from a good place. 
- I’m going to put more energy positively modeling what I want liberal movements to do, and spend less time articulating what I wish conservatives would do less of. 
- I am going to work to develop a political vision that leans less on what I want to protect, and more we want to accomplish (I recognise that we are now in a uniquely defensive and challenging position with an autocrat rising to power in the US, but I think doing this will help galvanize to unseat him). 
- I am going to stop describing or addressing demographies as monoliths (and yes, I realise the irony of writing to liberals in this post as though they are monolith :) ).
