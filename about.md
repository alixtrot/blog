	<p class="intro">I am the executive director of <a href="www.theengineroom.org">The Engine Room</a> - in a nutshell, we work together to help you use data and tech to change your world. Currently, I'm on leave, burrowing into a small corner of Open Society Foundations to learn more about the challenges funders face when they encounter data and tech in the work they support. This blog will host thoughts on the use of data and technology for social change; the curious journies of continuous learning; the nebulous art of managing remote teams; and the weird and intriguing strewn by others around the internet. Mostly, it's for me, to remind myself that taking the extra time to fully form thoughts is worth it in the long run. That said, I hope you find it interesting. Feel free to <a href="mailto:alix@trot.io">drop a line</a> if you feel so inclined.</p>
